# Korg Minilogue – Generative, Reactive MIDI Sequencing

![Max4Live Device](/Images/max-device.png)
### Introduction

This project was completed as part of my university module on computer music design, with the goal of creating a software solution to overcome inherent limits of fixed-architecture audio synthesis, exploring the creative potential of introducing generative patterns into the music-making process 
in both live performance and recording settings.

This involved designing a virtual MIDI control surface with Max/MSP to introduce "semi-modular" capabilities to the Korg Minilogue. The finished patch introduces evolving modulation sequences to MIDI control parameters, both random and responsive.

### Project goals

#### High-level
- Build a tool to satisfy my own curiosity and provide creative utility to others

#### Design/technical
- Introduce responsive, generative and pseudo-random data streams to extend the capabilities of a fixed architecture synthesizer, with flexibility for other devices in future

#### Learning goals
- Gain fluency in Max/MSP
- Develop knowledge of MIDI communications and standards
- Improve user interface design skills in the context of music technology

## Project justification/inspiration


#### Limitations of the Korg Minilogue

- Limited built-in 16-step sequencer
- Only 2 basic LFOs without phase/trigger controls or complex modulation- only basic waveforms.
- Limited signal routing- no routing matrix
- No random or generative elements

#### Inspiration
- Modular hardware platforms such as Eurorack
- [VCV Rack](https://vcvrack.com/) virtual modular synthesis
- Andrew Norris’ [Minilogue Controller](https://andrewnorris.uk/minilogue-controller/)

### Development Process

#### Research and discovery
- Studied Max [documentation](https://docs.cycling74.com/), browsed forums and drafted ideas for the project's goals
- Installed MaxMSP and began experimenting with creating and modifying simple patches 
- Studied the MIDI interface standard, including MIDI CC and routing


#### Planning and presentation

- Determined project bounds and fundamentals
- Presented my proposal to the class and project lead. Received feedback and questions


#### Design

1.	Read, documented and verified Minilogue MIDI CC parameter [addresses](#minilogue-midi-cc-parameters) using Ableton Live 
2. Established two-way communication between Max and the Minilogue and developed functionality
3. Frontend- designed a polished user interface with color themes and audio-reactive sonograph.
4. Compiled the patch as a Max4Live plugin.
