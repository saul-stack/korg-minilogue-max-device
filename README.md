# Korg Minilogue – Generative, Reactive MIDI Sequencing

## Introduction

This project was completed as part of my university module on computer music design, with the goal of creating a software solution to overcome inherent limits of fixed-architecture audio synthesis, exploring the creative potential of introducing generative patterns into the music-making process 
in both live performance and recording settings.

This involved designing a virtual MIDI control surface with Max/MSP to introduce "semi-modular" capabilities to the Korg Minilogue. The finished patch introduces evolving modulation sequences to MIDI control parameters, both random and responsive.

#### Personal notes
> As the Minilogue doesn't use continuous potentiometers, priority is given to controls in the Max patch to prevent controls from snapping back awkwardly.
